    Rabhindranath Tagore also Rabhindranath Thakur was born on 7 May 1861 in Kolkata ,Bengal.  
He was a poet , novelist and philosopher.He is the one who wrote our "NATIONAL ANTHEM" which 
is our pride , he gave various works in language field like Sonar Tari, Getanjali , Manasi 
etc. He was youngest of his 13 siblings and was nicknamed as "Rab" or "Rabi".Tagore was a 
Bengali Brahman  by birth.Even during the last decade of his life, Tagore continued his
activism.He criticized Mohandas Gandhi, one of India's leaders, for his comments about an
earthquake on January 15, 1934 in Bihar. Gandhi had said the earthquake had happened
because God wanted topunish people for practicing casteism.



    He saved West Bengal from being divided into 2 parts , by writing the song ' Banglar 
Mati Banglar Jol' which enhanced unity between the Bengal population. He also started Rakhi
Utsav , where the hindu and muslim communities tied Rakhi to eachother . Hence , 
in 1911 the 2 parts of Bengal were united. In 1913, Tagore got Noble Prize in Literature
and  was the first Asian  to win Nobel Prize. He invested his Nobel Prize money in building 
the campus and a town in Bolpur, West Bengal. He named the place as Shantiniketan, the
abode of peace. His educational reforms are included in many regions across the world. 



    He wrote around 2,230 songs. People call these songs "Rabindra Sangeet" (which means
"Tagore Song" in English). These songs are now a part of modern Bengali culture. 
Tagore's many poems and songs are parts of his novels and stories.His songs and music
cover many aspects of human emotion, devotional hymns, and love songs. In most 
Bengali-speaking families, people sing Rabindra Sangeet'. At age 60, Tagore took an interest in
drawing and painting. He used many styles from different parts of the world. His styles 
included craftwork by the Malanggan people.
